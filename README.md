# VoxelSpaceEngine

A voxel space engine made using [dos-like](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like) and the C programming language by following the YouTube video [Voxel Space (Comanche Terrain Rendering)](https://youtu.be/bQBY9BM9g_Y) by Gustavo Pezzi.

The render algorithm of the Voxel Space Engine is also explained by Sebastian Macke [here](https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace).
