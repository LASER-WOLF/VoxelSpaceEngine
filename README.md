# VoxelSpaceEngine

Voxel space engine made using the [DOS-like](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like) framework with the C programming language by following the YouTube video [Voxel Space (Comanche Terrain Rendering)](https://youtu.be/bQBY9BM9g_Y) by Gustavo Pezzi.

The render algorithm is also explained by Sebastian Macke [here](https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace).
